## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Hierarchy Structure
```
Owner (Property Owner)
  ↓
Manager (Property Manager) - Can assign to supervisors & staff
  ↓
Supervisor (Department Head) - Can assign to their staff
  ↓
Staff (Worker) - Executes tasks
```

### Task Workflow
```
1. PENDING     → Created by Owner/Manager
2. ASSIGNED    → Assigned to Staff by Supervisor
3. IN_PROGRESS → Started by Staff
4. COMPLETED   → Completed by Staff (with proof photos)
5. VERIFIED    → Verified by Supervisor/Manager ✅
   OR
   REJECTED    → Sent back for rework ❌
```

## 🛠️ How to Complete Implementation

### Quick Start (15-30 minutes)

#### Step 1: Complete Routes
Add to `routes/web.php`:

```php
// Owner - Staff Management
Route::middleware(['auth'])->prefix('owner')->name('owner.')->group(function () {
    Route::resource('staff', Staff\OwnerStaffController::class);
});

// Manager Dashboard (requires manager role)
Route::middleware(['auth', 'staff.role:manager'])->prefix('manager')->name('manager.')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', [Staff\ManagerDashboardController::class, 'index'])->name('dashboard');
});

// Supervisor Dashboard (requires supervisor role)
Route::middleware(['auth', 'staff.role:supervisor'])->prefix('supervisor')->name('supervisor.')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', [Staff\SupervisorDashboardController::class, 'index'])->name('dashboard');
});

// Staff Dashboard (any staff role)
Route::middleware(['auth', 'staff.role'])->prefix('staff')->name('staff.')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', [Staff\StaffDashboardController::class, 'index'])->name('dashboard');
});
```

See `STAFF_HIERARCHY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for complete routes.

#### Step 2: Implement Dashboard Controllers
Use the pattern from `OwnerStaffController`. Each dashboard just needs an `index()` method:

```php
public function index()
{
    $staffMember = auth()->user()->staffMember;
    
    // Load relevant data based on role
    $data = [
        'todaysTasks' => $staffMember->getTodaysTasks(),
        'overdueTasks' => $staffMember->getOverdueTasks(),
        // ... etc
    ];
    
    return view('staff.manager.dashboard', $data);
}
```

#### Step 3: Create Basic Views
Start with simple dashboards using Tailwind:

```blade
{{-- resources/views/staff/manager/dashboard.blade.php --}}
@extends('layouts.app')

@section('content')
<div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Manager Dashboard</h1>
    
    {{-- Stats Cards --}}
    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4 gap-6 mb-6">
        {{-- Total Staff --}}
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-6">
            <div class="text-sm text-gray-500">Total Staff</div>
            <div class="text-3xl font-bold mt-2">{{ $totalStaff }}</div>
        </div>
        {{-- Add more cards --}}
    </div>
    
    {{-- Recent Tasks --}}
    <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-6">
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">Recent Tasks</h2>
        {{-- Task list --}}
    </div>
</div>
@endsection
```

#### Step 4: Test with Sample Data
Use the test data creation code in `STAFF_HIERARCHY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` to:
1. Create a manager, supervisor, and staff member
2. Create a test task
3. Test the complete workflow
