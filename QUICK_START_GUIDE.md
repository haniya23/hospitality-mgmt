## 🏃 **Getting Started in 5 Minutes**

### Step 1: Verify Installation
```bash
# Check migrations
php artisan migrate:status | grep staff

# Check departments
php artisan tinker --execute="echo App\Models\StaffDepartment::count() . ' departments'"
```

### Step 2: Create Test Data
```bash
php artisan tinker
```

Then run this code:
```php
use App\Models\{User, Property, StaffMember, Task};
use Illuminate\Support\{Str, Facades\Hash};

// Get your owner account
$owner = User::first();
$property = $owner->properties->first();

// Create Manager
$managerUser = User::create([
    'uuid' => Str::uuid(),
    'name' => 'John Manager',
    'email' => 'manager@test.com',
    'mobile_number' => '1234567890',
    'password' => Hash::make('password'),
    'user_type' => 'staff',
    'is_staff' => true,
    'is_active' => true,
]);

$manager = StaffMember::create([
    'uuid' => Str::uuid(),
    'user_id' => $managerUser->id,
    'property_id' => $property->id,
    'department_id' => 2,
    'staff_role' => 'manager',
    'job_title' => 'Property Manager',
    'employment_type' => 'full_time',
    'join_date' => today(),
    'status' => 'active',
]);

// Create Supervisor
$supervisorUser = User::create([
    'uuid' => Str::uuid(),
    'name' => 'Jane Supervisor',
    'email' => 'supervisor@test.com',
    'mobile_number' => '1234567891',
    'password' => Hash::make('password'),
    'user_type' => 'staff',
    'is_staff' => true,
    'is_active' => true,
]);

$supervisor = StaffMember::create([
    'uuid' => Str::uuid(),
    'user_id' => $supervisorUser->id,
    'property_id' => $property->id,
    'department_id' => 2,
    'staff_role' => 'supervisor',
    'job_title' => 'Housekeeping Supervisor',
    'reports_to' => $manager->id,
    'employment_type' => 'full_time',
    'join_date' => today(),
    'status' => 'active',
]);

// Create Staff Member
$staffUser = User::create([
    'uuid' => Str::uuid(),
    'name' => 'Bob Staff',
    'email' => 'staff@test.com',
    'mobile_number' => '1234567892',
    'password' => Hash::make('password'),
    'user_type' => 'staff',
    'is_staff' => true,
    'is_active' => true,
]);

$staff = StaffMember::create([
    'uuid' => Str::uuid(),
    'user_id' => $staffUser->id,
    'property_id' => $property->id,
    'department_id' => 2,
    'staff_role' => 'staff',
    'job_title' => 'Room Attendant',
    'reports_to' => $supervisor->id,
    'employment_type' => 'full_time',
    'join_date' => today(),
    'status' => 'active',
]);

echo "✅ Created: Manager, Supervisor, and Staff member\n";
echo "📧 Login emails:\n";
echo "   Manager: manager@test.com\n";
echo "   Supervisor: supervisor@test.com\n";
echo "   Staff: staff@test.com\n";
echo "🔑 Password: password\n";
```

### Step 3: Test Logins

1. **Manager Login**: `manager@test.com` / `password`
   - Should redirect to: `/manager/dashboard`
   
2. **Supervisor Login**: `supervisor@test.com` / `password`
   - Should redirect to: `/supervisor/dashboard`
   
3. **Staff Login**: `staff@test.com` / `password`
   - Should redirect to: `/staff/dashboard`

### Step 4: Test Full Workflow

1. **As Owner** (`/owner/staff`):
   - View all staff members
   - Click on staff to see details

2. **As Manager** (`/manager/dashboard`):
   - See supervisors and staff overview
