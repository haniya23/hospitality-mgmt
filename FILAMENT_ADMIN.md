## Technical Implementation

- **Resources**: Auto-generated CRUD interfaces
- **Widgets**: Dashboard statistics

## Usage
1. Access admin panel at `/admin`
2. Login with admin credentials

The admin panel is completely separate from the property owner interface, ensuring clear separation of concerns and enhanced security.
